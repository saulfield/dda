# Digital Differential Analyzer

This is just a quick sketch of a differential analyzer for an FPGA. Currently it just does basic Euler integration to solve the differential equation dy/dt = y. I hope to revisit and extend this in the future, optimistically to compile some declarative representation of ODEs to Verilog.
